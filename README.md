# Simple Blockchain for a Cryptocurrency

The script provided contains the backbones of a simple Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchain intended for transactions of a cryptocurrency, in this case, Sopa.

This script was developed in *Python 3.6* and was tailored to run along with *Postman* so to have a local server that could process transactions.
